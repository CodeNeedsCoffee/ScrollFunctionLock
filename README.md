# ScrollFunctionLock
Function Lock Simulation for Razer Pro Type Ultra

## Purpose
The Razer Pro Type Ultra lacks the ability to "Function Lock" or to switch the default usage on the function keys. I've created two profiles and used the Scroll lock as a profile switcher to simulate the use of a Function Lock.

## Installation Guide
Install & log into Razer Synapse on your PC. Download the latest release and extract the .synapse3 file. Once extraction is complete, open Synapse and open the Customize section under the Keyboard section. Click the ... next to the profile and select Import. Then click the folder icon and find the extracted .synapse3 file and Click Import. Once the import is complete, select Normal from the profile and you're good to go.

## Usage
Tap the scr lck key to swap between profiles. The FunctionLock profile will use the function keys rahter than the initial programmed shortcuts. The Normal profile will use normal key functionality.
